==Booktabs==
Booktabs is a very simple Chrome extension which will save and load specific tabs by putting commands into the Omnibox/location bar.

To use it, type "tabs" and then hit tab.  After that:

<UL>
<LI><b>save</b> {tabname} : will save the currently loaded tabs as {tabname}.</LI>
<LI><b>load</b> {tabname} : will load the tabs stored as {tabname}.</LI>
<LI>{tabname} : will load the tabs stored as {tabname}.</LI>
<LI><b>delete</b> {tabname} : will remove the tabs saved as {tabname}.</LI>
<LI><b>delete</b> {tabname1},{tabname2},etc. : will remove the tabs saved as {tabname1},{tabname2},etc.</LI>
<LI><b>list</b> : will popup and alert and send to the console a list of currently saved tab names.</LI>
</UL>
